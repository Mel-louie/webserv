# webserv 100%

This project is here to make us write our own HTTP server. We will be able to test it with a real browser. HTTP is one of the most used protocol on internet. Knowing its arcane will be useful, even if you won't be working on a website. We must refer HTTP 1.1.
This is a group project. We were two to work on it. We learn to organize ourselves, and help each other, to work on a common project. It was sometimes challenging, but we learned a lot.
